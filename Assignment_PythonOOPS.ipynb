        "\n",
        "Ans. Method Overriding is a feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a child class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most popular programming paradigms, and it offers several key advantages for software development. Let's look at the main benefits of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Modularity (Encapsulation)\n",
        "Encapsulation allows objects to hide their internal states and only expose a public interface for interaction. This means that you can modify the internal implementation of an object without affecting other parts of the system that rely on it.\n",
        "\n",
        "This modular structure leads to easier maintenance, as changes can be made in isolated areas of the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: You can change the internal data structures of an object without affecting code that uses that object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Reusability (Inheritance)\n",
        "Inheritance allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, facilitating code reuse. You can extend or modify functionality without rewriting code.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps in reducing redundancy and speeds up development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: You can create a Dog class that inherits from a Mammal class, and the Dog will automatically inherit properties and methods of Mammal.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Scalability (Extensibility)\n",
        "OOP makes it easier to extend and scale your code. You can add new features without disrupting existing functionality, thanks to inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding new classes or methods is less likely to break existing code, making the program extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Adding a new Bird class to a program that already has Mammal and Fish classes won't affect the other parts of the system, as the new class just needs to follow the existing interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Maintainability\n",
        "OOP promotes cleaner, organized code that is easier to maintain. The use of objects and classes makes it easier to locate where changes need to be made.\n",
        "\n",
        "Methods like abstraction help separate concerns, meaning developers can focus on specific parts of the system without needing to understand the entire program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: If a bug is found in the Car class, only that class needs to be updated, rather than going through the entire codebase.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for different data types. This means that you can write generic code that works with objects of different classes, leading to flexibility and extensibility in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different classes can have methods with the same name but different behavior, making your code more adaptive to changing requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: You can write a method to handle any shape (circle, rectangle, etc.), and polymorphism allows it to call the correct area() method for each type of shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Abstraction\n",
        "Abstraction allows you to hide complexity and expose only the essential features of an object. This simplifies the interaction with objects and helps developers focus on high-level functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Users interact with a simplified view of the object, while the complex implementation remains hidden.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In a Car class, users don't need to know the inner workings of how the engine starts. They can simply call the start_engine() method, which abstracts the complexity of starting the engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Security (Data Hiding)\n",
        "OOP's encapsulation also provides security by protecting an object's state from unwanted access or modification. By controlling access to the object's attributes and methods (through public, private, or protected access modifiers), you ensure that sensitive data is protected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In a banking system, you may have a BankAccount class where the account balance is private, and can only be accessed through public methods like deposit() and withdraw(), which apply business logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Faster Development and Debugging\n",
        "OOP allows developers to work in parallel on different parts of the system due to its modularity. Since objects are self-contained, multiple developers can work on different classes without interfering with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "Debugging is also easier because of clear boundaries between objects and their methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: In a team working on an e-commerce system, one developer can focus on the Cart class while another works on the Payment class without any conflicts."

        "\n",
        "The subclass gets methods and attributes from all parent classes.\n",
